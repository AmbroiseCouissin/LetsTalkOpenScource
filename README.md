## The OpenSource Movement

Art teaches us about ourselves both as a critical comment on society and as creative individuals with free thought. 

PostModernism by its own right is dead. So what is the next movement?

Open source is the next creative movement in as far as it is a social commentary and reflection of human nature for people by people who want to create.

Linux is the worlds first and biggest OpenSource project. The founder Linus Torvalds may not have been aware of the full potential his Operating system would have on society at large but it has created a paradigm shift in the way we do things in our daily lives not just as developers and engineers but as a society. From Linus and its biggest implementation Android to VisualCode, to BitCoin Blockchain crypto currencies to crowd funding, from 3D software (blender) and 3D printers to space exploration and military application, from DYI electronics like Arduino and the Raspberry Pi to begin off the grid: OpenSource has hugely changed the way we think about the would  and engage with each other be it for business, personal or lifestyle. But more importantly the OpenSource movement has illustrated that humans have an ornate desire for community and sharing for the greater good.

## OpenSource Hardware & IoT
[Tesla Motors](https://www.teslamotors.com/en_HK/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you) - Tesla release their patients to the public in the name of the environment. 
_’We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.’_

### Questions
- What does OpenSource mean to you?
- What are some of the OpenSource tools you use today and why?
- When should you OpenSource your project? 
- Can OpenSource be enterprise quality software? 
- Android and RedHat has managed to monetise Linux, do you consider this ethical to OpenSource core values? 
- An OpenSource project is only as strong as its community. Do you agree? Can you give some examples of where a community has proven or disproven this?
- What are some of the exciting new open source projects you are aware of?
- How do you discover new open source projects, trending GitHub Bitbucket repos, Twitter or elsewhere?
- Git is crucial to OpenSource projects and GitHub has played an important roll in the OpenSource community can you share some experiences and interactions you’ve encountered through GitHub?
- What do you see the future of OpenSource being? Hybrid open and closed source? licences..
- Can OpenSource work for non-code projects?

## Bambi
- Your background is in Microsoft Azures and given you have moved to using OpenSource tools what security concerns have you seen?
- What are some client concerns regarding OpenSource such as licensing and privacy?
- How has the DevOps space been influenced by OpenSource projects like Vagrant, Docker & Heroku?

### Valter
- How has Unit testing been improved by the OpenSource community?
- From your experience what does Google and Facebook have to gain from open sourcing their JavaScript Frameworks Angular and React?
- 

### Vlad
- Choosing a database: MySLQ is OpenSource but its not the most popular DataBase in the web sphere superseded by MongoDB & Postgres. How has OpenSource influenced the growth of smaller niche DataBases like CouchDB, Level, ReThinkDB etc. And can OpenSource damage existing OpenSource projects or is the competitiveness competition healthy? What are your thoughts on this? 
- Whats you exp with os and blue chip clients
- How can enterprise solutions be realised using OpenSource tools and can you talk about real world aplications of this?
- Can you talk about how the OpenSource movement has influence payment gateways like Stripe and Square Space?

### Chris
- Can you explain how Blockchain maintains both anonymity and security? 

### Rhys
- What is the OpenSource hardware model?
- Do you see the way OpenSource projects borrow or appropriate from one another as a good or bad thing and can if effect a code base? Does OpenSource cause more work than say an enterprise solution because of all the versions and iterations and contributors? I think some projects die because of the competition. 
For example in the ActionScript battle for 3D frameworks first to the scene was PaperView3D which was great but had major issues because it was rushed while Away3D was slower but more solid. Eventually Away3D took over and was adopted into ActionScript. These projects borrowed each others methodologies when needed and they were every similar but the issue was that they had completely different code basses and often projects using 3D wold switch between the libraries causing huge refactoring problems. 
- Can you think of an example where non OpenSource projects are better, Wordpress vs Joomla for example, and explain why?

## Notes & Thoughts
- Commercial worries. People taking advantage of your work. Ownership and ego.
